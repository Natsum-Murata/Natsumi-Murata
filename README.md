Iâ€™m Natsumi, a professional sales, marketer, and data analyst with +8 years of experience in the education industry. My skills include relationship building, customer service, problem-solving, business analytics, data visualization (Tableau and Looker Studio), SQL, Salesforce, Pardot, and WordPress. 

Currently, I am working with customer and student data to find ways of raising conversations and retention. Throughout my career, I have worked with clients directly which cultivated my communication skills and problem-solving skills. In 2023, I completed the MBA from the University of the People. During the MBA, I had a lot of chances to work with people from all over the world, which established my cultural intelligence and broadened my perspectives. In 2024, I enrolled in the TripleTen Business Intelligence program. It provided my practical application for analytical skills. 

Some facts about me: 
-	I love to do DIY. 
-	I like to play sports such as tennis, pickleball, kickball, and running. Every year I participate local race! 
-	I love to choose presents! My Christmas shopping starts in the summertime. 
-	My goal for 2024 is to land a new job in data.
